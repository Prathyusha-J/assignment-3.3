			ASSIGNMENT 3.3

1) List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail.

A) HADOOP 2.x:
              * HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced 
             features. It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
              * 

MAJOR COMPONENTS :
              * The three components are also known as Three Pillars of Hadoop 2.
	-- HDFS
                  -- YARN
	-- MapReduce

1) YARN :
              * YARN is the architectural center of Hadoop that allows multiple data processing engines such as interactive SQL, real-time streaming, 
                  data science to handle data stored in a single platform.
              * YARN is the prerequisite for Enterprise Hadoop, providing resource management and a central platform, security
              * It extends the power of Hadoop to new technologies within the data center so that they can take advantage of cost effective processing.
              * YARN is the foundation of the new generation of Hadoop and is enabling organizations everywhere to realize a modern data 
                architecture.
              
              FEATURES - 1) Multi-tenancy - YARN allows multiple access engines  to use Hadoop as the common standard for batch.
		  2) Scalability - Data center processing power continues to rapidly expand. 
		  3) Cluster utilization - Improves utilization over more static MapReduce rules used in early versions of Hadoop.

2) HDFS :
            * HDFS is the Hadoop file system and comprises two major components: namespaces and blocks storage service. 
               -- The namespace service manages operations on files and directories, such as creating and modifying files and directories. 
               -- The block storage service implements data node block operations and replication. 
            *  With HDFS federation, multiple Namenode servers manage namespaces and this allows for horizontal scaling, performance
                improvements, and multiple namespaces.
            *  Moving to HDFS federation requires formatting Namenodes, updating to use the latest Hadoop cluster software.
            * It also requires the mode of  adding additional Namenodes to the cluster in order to meet the requirements.

	FEATURES - 1) High performance support for MapReduce applications.
		      2)Ease of deployment requires separate clusters for analytics and databases.

3)MAPREDUCE :
         * In MapReduce MRv2, the functions of the JobTracker have been split between three services. 
         * The ResourceManager is a persistent YARN service that receives and runs applications (a MapReduce job is an application) on the cluster. 
         * It contains the scheduler, which, as previously, is pluggable. 
         * The MapReduce-specific capabilities of the JobTracker have been moved into the MapReduce Application Master, one of which is 
            started to manage each MapReduce job and terminated when the job completes.
         * It is responsible for launching containers, each of which can house a map or reduce task.	

	COMPONENTS - 1) The JobTracker function of serving information about completed jobs has been moved to the JobHistory Server. 
		             2)The TaskTracker has been replaced with the NodeManager, a YARN service that manages resources and 
                                                     deployment on a host.
